# MQA-with-Scene-Graphs
This projects experiments with the recent approaches to enhancing visual question answering using scene graphs
The following plan was followed:
1. IDEFIC model was evaluated on GQA dataset to obtain __ accuracy
2. Analysis of each question type was done to understand shortcomings of the model
3. IDEFICs model was prompted with ground truth scene graph to observe accuracy jump of __. This proves that scene graphs add valuable information for the model to answer questions. Especially in case of __ type of questions.
4. Multiple prompting strategies were observed to find the best was ___.
5. Scene graph generation models were experiemented with for best results.
